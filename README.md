End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Predicting Company Profits
This project aims to predict the profits of companies in various U.S. states (California, New York, and Florida) based on their investments in R&D, Administration, and Marketing departments. The model is built using machine learning techniques to process the data and generate accurate profit predictions.

Project Overview
The dataset used in this project is 1000_Companies.csv, which includes the following key features:

R&D Spend: Investment in research and development.
Administration: Investment in administration.
Marketing Spend: Investment in marketing.
State: Location of the company (California, New York, Florida).
Profit: The target variable (profit earned by the company).
The notebook walks through the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
seaborn: For advanced statistical plotting.
scikit-learn: For building machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
Installation
To install the required dependencies, use the requirements.txt file provided. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Steps in the Project
Loading the Data: The data is loaded using pandas and inspected to understand its structure.
Data Visualization: Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn to analyze the relationships between the features and the target variable (profit).
Data Preprocessing:
Handling categorical variables (e.g., converting "State" to numerical form).
Scaling numerical data for better model performance.
Model Building:
Multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict profits.
Other models such as ensemble methods are explored.
Model Evaluation: Performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Model Serialization: The trained model is saved using pickle for future use.
How to Run the Project
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
cd <repository-directory>
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook to walk through the analysis and model building process:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook ml_asmt_end_to_end_project_032.ipynb
Dataset
The dataset 1000_Companies.csv should be placed in the working directory. You can download it from Kaggle or another source that provides similar data on company investments and profits.

Results
The machine learning models built in this notebook provide insights into which factors are most influential in determining company profits. The final model can be used to predict profits for new companies based on their investments.
