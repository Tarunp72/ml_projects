# **End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Predicting Company Profits**

This project aims to predict the profits of companies in various U.S. states (California, New York, and Florida) based on their investments in R&D, Administration, and Marketing departments. The model is built using machine learning techniques to process the data and generate accurate profit predictions.

## **Project Overview**

The dataset used in this project is `1000_Companies.csv`, which includes the following key features:
- **R&D Spend**: Investment in research and development.
- **Administration**: Investment in administration.
- **Marketing Spend**: Investment in marketing.
- **State**: Location of the company (California, New York, Florida).
- **Profit**: The target variable (profit earned by the company).

The notebook walks through the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## **Dependencies**

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For advanced statistical plotting.
- `scikit-learn`: For building machine learning models and evaluating their performance.



## **Steps in the Project**

1. **Loading the Data**: The data is loaded using `pandas` and inspected to understand its structure.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualizations are created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to analyze the relationships between the features and the target variable (profit).
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling categorical variables (e.g., converting "State" to numerical form).
   - Scaling numerical data for better model performance.
4. **Model Building**:
   - Multiple linear regression model using `scikit-learn` to predict profits.
   - Other models such as ensemble methods are explored.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
6. **Model Serialization**: The trained model is saved using `pickle` for future use.



# Company Profit Prediction

## Dataset
The dataset `1000_Companies.csv` should be placed in the working directory. You can download it from Kaggle or another source that provides similar data on company investments and profits.

## Results
The machine learning models built in this notebook provide insights into which factors are most influential in determining company profits. The final model can be used to predict profits for new companies based on their investments.
