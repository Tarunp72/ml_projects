# **End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Predicting Company Profits**

This project aims to predict the profits of companies in various U.S. states (California, New York, and Florida) based on their investments in R&D, Administration, and Marketing departments. The model is built using machine learning techniques to process the data and generate accurate profit predictions.

## **Project Overview**

The dataset used in this project is `1000_Companies.csv`, which includes the following key features:
- **R&D Spend**: Investment in research and development.
- **Administration**: Investment in administration.
- **Marketing Spend**: Investment in marketing.
- **State**: Location of the company (California, New York, Florida).
- **Profit**: The target variable (profit earned by the company).

The notebook walks through the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## **Dependencies**

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For advanced statistical plotting.
- `scikit-learn`: For building machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
